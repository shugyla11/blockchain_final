      <h2>Animal Information</h2>
      <p>Learn about the animals we help and how we contribute to their welfare. Understand the importance of habitat conservation, the threats many species face, and how you can help.</p>
      <h3>Key Species Under Threat</h3>
      <p>Our charity focuses on several key species that are under threat, including marine turtles, forest elephants, and various bird species. These animals face challenges such as loss of habitat, pollution, and illegal poaching. We work on the ground to protect their natural habitats, rescue animals from harmful situations, and rehabilitate them back into the wild whenever possible.</p>
      <h3>Educational Programs and Community Involvement</h3>
      <p>We also run educational programs aimed at local communities and schools to spread awareness about the importance of conservation and how human activities impact wildlife. Our efforts extend to advocating for stronger wildlife protection laws and supporting sustainable practices that benefit both animals and humans.</p>
      <h3>How You Can Help</h3>
      <p>By supporting our charity, you are helping to ensure that these magnificent creatures can thrive in their natural habitats for generations to come. We encourage you to learn more about each species we support, understand their specific needs and challenges, and join us in our efforts to protect them.</p>
